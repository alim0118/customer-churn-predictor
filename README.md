# Customer Churn Predictor (SAP x WiDS Case Competition)

Uncovered customer churn factors in SAP's AI-driven products, employing machine learning and data analysis methodologies in Python, within the SAP x WiDs Case Competition.


## Problem Statement <!--- do not change this line -->

In the heart of technological advancement, SAP stands tall as a pioneer in delivering AI-powered software solutions. However, within this realm, SAP encounters a puzzling dilemma: whether to further their investment in AI, risk the potential churn of some long-term customers, or hold back from AI investments while competitors forge ahead in this area.  


## Key Results <!--- do not change this line -->

Built a customer churn prediction model using Random Forest classification with scikit-learn in Python, achieving an accuracy of 75% and ranking in the top 10 out of 21 teams.


## Methodologies <!--- do not change this line -->

To accomplish this, we utilized the Random Forest classification algorithm from scikit-learn in Python to build a predictive model. The data was then preprocessed and analyzed by performing univariate and bivariate data analyses along with feature engineering using NumPy, pandas, and seaborn. Visualizations like heatmaps, histograms, and boxplots were used to identify patterns and correlations between features. To identify the most relevant features influencing customer churn, Random Forest's feature importance function was applied. The model was then re-fitted with the top 5 features. Confusion matrices were used to evaluate the model's prediction performance on the test set. By examining metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score, we assessed the model's ability to correctly classify churners and non-churners.
